# The Word of the Buddha

Monorepo for digital editions of Ajahn Brahm's translation of Word of the Buddha.

1. The initial digital source is the `/pdf` file, which is a scan of the print edition by the publisher.
1. From here I extracted the text to get the `/epub` content, and styled it accordingly. See the changelog for details.
1. I then used that to make the `/web` version. See the changelog there for futher stylistic adjustments to the content.
