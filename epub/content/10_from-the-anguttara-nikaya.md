# From the Aṅguttara Nikāya

## Editor’s note

As mentioned in the Foreword, I have long campaigned for renderings of the suttas which accurately reflect the workings of the Buddhist path, which is not practised through willpower, but through letting go and renouncing, thereby enabling it to unfold as a natural process of cause and effect. “Stillness” rather than “concentration”, as a rendering of _samādhi_, is but one example of this. All too often, this crucial idea is missed or forgotten by practitioners to the detriment of their own happiness and progress on the path; therefore it warrants extra emphasis. It is for this reason that I append the following passages from the Aṅguttara Nikāya. These lay out the stages of the path explicitly, from several angles, all highlighting its impersonal, purely causal nature. Let no doubt remain!

## 5.21 Irreverent

Meditators, when a meditator is irreverent and undeferential, and their behaviour is uncongenial to their fellow meditators, it is impossible for them to fulfil the factor of proper conduct.

Without fulfilling the factor of proper conduct, it is impossible for them to fulfil the factor of a trainee.

Without fulfilling the factor of a trainee, it is impossible for them to fulfil virtuous behaviour.

Without fulfilling virtuous behaviour, it is impossible for them to fulfil right view.

Without fulfilling right view, it is impossible for them to fulfil jhāna (_sammā samādhi_).

But, when a meditator is reverential and deferential, and their behaviour is congenial to their fellow meditators, it is possible for them to fulfil the duty of proper conduct.

Having fulfilled the duty of proper conduct, it is possible for them to fulfil the duty of a trainee.

Having fulfilled the duty of a trainee, it is possible for them to fulfil virtuous behaviour.

Having fulfilled virtuous behaviour, it is possible for them to fulfil right view.

Having fulfilled right view, it is possible for them to fulfil jhāna (_sammā samādhi_).

## 8.81 Mindfulness

Meditators, when there is no mindfulness and wisdom, the sense of moral shame and moral dread (_hirīottappa_) lacks a necessary cause.

When there is no sense of moral shame and moral dread, restraint of the sense faculties lacks a necessary cause.

When there is no restraint of the sense faculties, virtuous behaviour lacks a necessary cause.

When there is no virtuous behaviour, jhāna (_sammā samādhi_) lacks a necessary cause.

When there is no jhāna, the knowledge and vision of things as they really are lacks a necessary cause.

When there is no knowledge and vision of things as they really are, revulsion (_nibbidā_) and fading away lack a necessary cause.

When there is no revulsion and fading away, liberation lacks a necessary cause.

When a tree is deficient in branches and foliage, its new shoots, bark, softwood, and heartwood do not grow to fullness. So too, when there is no mindfulness and wisdom … liberation lacks a necessary cause.

Meditators, when there is mindfulness and wisdom, the sense of moral shame and moral dread possess their necessary cause.

When a tree is sufficient in branches and foliage, its new shoots, bark, softwood, and heartwood grow to fullness. So too, when there is mindfulness and wisdom … liberation possesses its main cause.

## 10.61 Delusion

Meditators, some say that a first beginning of delusion cannot be seen such that, before then, there was only wisdom and after then delusion came to exist.

I say that delusion has a nutriment. The nutriment for delusion is the five hindrances.

The five hindrances have a nutriment: the three kinds of misconduct.

The three kinds of misconduct have a nutriment: lack of sense restraint.

Lack of sense restraint has a nutriment: lack of mindfulness and wisdom.

Lack of mindfulness and wisdom has a nutriment: careless attention (_ayoniso manasikāra_).

Careless attention has a nutriment: lack of faith.

Lack of faith has a nutriment: not hearing the true Dhamma.

Not hearing the true Dhamma has a nutriment: not associating with good
persons.

Thus not associating with good persons, becoming full, fills up not hearing the good Dhamma.

Not hearing the good Dhamma, becoming full, fills up lack of faith.

Lack of faith, becoming full, fills up careless attention.

Careless attention, becoming full, fills up lack of mindfulness and wisdom.

Lack of mindfulness and wisdom, becoming full, fills up non-restraint of the sense faculties.

Non-restraint of the sense faculties, becoming full, fills up the three kinds of misconduct.

The three kinds of misconduct, becoming full, fill up the five hindrances.

The five hindrances, becoming full, fill up delusion.

Thus there is nutriment for delusion, and in this way it keeps full.

Just as when rain pours down in thick droplets on a mountaintop, the water flows down along the slope and fills the clefts, gullies, and creeks; these, becoming full, fill up the pools; these, becoming full, fill up the lakes; these, becoming full, fill up the streams; these, becoming full, fill up the rivers; and these, becoming full, fill up the great ocean. Thus there is nutriment for the great ocean, and in this way it keeps full.

So too, not associating with good persons, becoming full, fills up not hearing the good Dhamma … The five hindrances, becoming full, fill up delusion. Thus there is nutriment for delusion, and in this way it keeps full.

Meditators, true knowledge and liberation have a nutriment: the seven factors of awakening.

The seven factors of awakening have a nutriment: the four focuses of mindfulness.

The four focuses of mindfulness have a nutriment: the three kinds of good conduct.

The three kinds of good conduct have a nutriment: restraint of the sense faculties.

Restraint of the sense faculties has a nutriment: mindfulness and wisdom.

Mindfulness and wisdom have a nutriment: careful attention (_yoniso manasikāra_).

Careful attention has a nutriment: faith.

Faith has a nutriment: hearing the true Dhamma.

Hearing the true Dhamma has a nutriment: associating with good persons.

Thus associating with good persons, becoming full, fills up hearing the true Dhamma.

Hearing the good Dhamma, becoming full, fills up faith.

Faith, becoming full, fills up careful attention.

Careful attention, becoming full, fills up mindfulness and wisdom.

Mindfulness and wisdom, becoming full, fill up restraint of the sense faculties.

Restraint of the sense faculties, becoming full, fills up the three kinds of good conduct.

The three kinds of good conduct, becoming full, fill up the four focuses of mindfulness.

The four focuses of mindfulness, becoming full, fill up the seven factors of awakening.

The seven factors of awakening, becoming full, fill up true knowledge and liberation.

Thus there is nutriment for true knowledge and liberation, and in this way they become full…

So too, associating with good persons, becoming full, fills up hearing the good Dhamma … The seven factors of awakening, becoming full, fill up true knowledge and liberation. Thus there is nutriment for true knowledge and liberation, and in this way they become full.

## 10.62 Craving

Meditators, some say that a first beginning of craving cannot be seen such that, before then, there was only contentment, and after then, craving came to exist.

Craving for existence has a nutriment: delusion.

Delusion has a nutriment: the five hindrances … \[as in 10:61]

Not hearing the true Dhamma has a nutriment, not associating with good persons.

Thus not associating with good persons, becoming full, fills up not hearing the good Dhamma … The five hindrances, becoming full, fill up delusion. Delusion, becoming full, fills up craving for existence. Thus there is nutriment for craving for existence, and in this way it keeps full…

So too, not associating with good persons, becoming full, fills up not hearing the good Dhamma ... and delusion, becoming full, fills up craving for existence. Thus there is nutriment for craving for existence, and in this way it keeps full.

True knowledge and liberation have a nutriment: the seven factors of awakening …

Hearing the true Dhamma, too, I say, has a nutriment: associating with good persons.

Thus associating with good persons, becoming full, fills up hearing the true Dhamma … the seven factors of awakening, becoming full, fill up true knowledge and liberation. Thus there is nutriment for true knowledge and liberation, and in
this way they become full.

## 10.76 Incapable
