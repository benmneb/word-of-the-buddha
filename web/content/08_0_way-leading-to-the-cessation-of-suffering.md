# IV. The Noble Truth of the Way Leading to the Cessation of Suffering

<span class="sutta-ref">SN 56.11</span> There are these two extremes that should be avoided. The pursuit of happiness through the five senses, which is low (_hīna_), secular, coarse, ignoble, unbeneficial, and the pursuit of practices that fatigue the body and mind, which is painful, ignoble, unbeneficial.

Without going to either of these extremes, the Buddha has awakened to the middle way, which gives rise to vision, which gives rise to wisdom, which leads to peace, to direct understanding, to awakening, to _nibbāna_.

It is this noble eightfold path: right view, right motivation, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right endeavour, right mindfulness, and right stillness.

This is that middle way awakened to by the Buddha, which gives rise to vision, which gives rise to wisdom, which leads to peace, to direct understanding, to awakening, to _nibbāna_.

<span class="sutta-ref">MN 139</span> The pursuit of pleasure that is linked to the five senses—low, secular, coarse, ignoble, and unbeneficial—is a state beset by suffering, frustration, despair, and fever, and it is the wrong way.

Disengagement from the pursuit of pleasure that is linked to the five senses—low, secular, coarse, ignoble, and unbeneficial—is a state without suffering, frustration, despair, and fever, and it is the right way.

<span class="sutta-ref">Dhp 273-274</span> The noble eightfold path is the best of all practices…<br />
This is the only path for purifying insight; there is no other.<br />
Follow this path and you will discombobulate Māra.

<span class="sutta-ref">MN 26</span> Listen, the end of dying has been reached. I shall instruct you, I shall teach you the Dhamma. Practising as you are instructed, by realising for yourselves in this very life through direct understanding you will soon enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which people rightly go forth into monastic life.
