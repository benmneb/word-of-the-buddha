# 4. Right Action

<span class="sutta-ref">DN 22</span> What, now, is right action?

Refraining from deliberately killing living beings, refraining from taking what is not given, refraining from sexual misconduct.

<span class="sutta-ref">AN 10.176</span> Refraining from deliberately killing living beings, you abstain from the destruction of life. With the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, you dwell compassionate toward all living beings.

Refraining from theft, you abstain from taking what is not given; you do not steal the wealth and property of others in the village or in the forest.

Refraining from sexual misconduct, you abstain from unlawful, abusive, sexual activity. You do not have sexual relations with those under the age of consent; with those who are unable to give consent (e.g., being mentally disabled); who are not free to refuse consent (such as a student to their teacher); where such conduct would be breaking a law; or with one already engaged.
