# III. The Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering

<span className="sutta-ref">SN 56.11</span> This is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same wanting (wanting related to the five senses, wanting for existence and wanting not to be); the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, never letting it settle enough to grow.

<span className="sutta-ref">DN 22</span> Wherever in the world there is anything agreeable and pleasurable; there the cessation of wanting comes about. And what is there in the world that is agreeable and pleasurable? Seeing the world is agreeable and pleasurable; hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and knowing is agreeable and pleasurable, and there this wanting comes to be abandoned, there its cessation comes about.

<span className="sutta-ref">SN 12.66</span> Whatever spiritual seekers in the past regarded pleasant and agreeable things in the world as impermanent, as suffering, as non-self, as an affliction, as fearful; they abandoned wanting.

## Dependent Cessation of all Phenomena

<span className="sutta-ref">SN 12.43</span> But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same wanting (_taṅhā_) comes cessation of fuel (_upādāna_); with the cessation of fuel, cessation of states of existence (_bhava_); with the cessation of states of existence, cessation
of rebirth (_jāti_); with the cessation of rebirth, old-age-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, unhappiness, and distress cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering. This is the passing away of suffering.

<span className="sutta-ref">SN 22.30</span> The cessation, subsiding, and passing away of form … of experience … of perception … of will … of consciousnesses … is the cessation of suffering, the subsiding of affliction, the passing away of old-age-and-death.

## Nibbāna with Residue Remaining

<span className="sutta-ref">AN 3.32</span> This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, the stilling (_samatha_) of all will (_saṅkhāra_), the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of wanting, fading away, cessation, _nibbāna_.

1. <span className="sutta-ref">SN 3.55</span> When excited by wanting, overcome by wanting …
1. When full of aversion, overcome by aversion …
1. When deluded, overcome by delusion …

…with mind obsessed by these—you intentionally create problems for yourself, for others, or for both, and you experience mental suffering and depression.

But when wanting, aversion and delusion are abandoned, you do not intentionally create any problems for yourself, for others, or for both, and you do not experience mental suffering and depression.

It is in this way that _nibbāna_ can be experienced directly.

<span className="sutta-ref">SN 38.1</span> \[Venerable Sāriputta:] The destruction of wanting, the destruction of aversion, the destruction of delusion: this is called _nibbāna_ (with residue remaining).

## The Arahant

If one is intent on the end of wanting and clarity of mind: when one sees the arising of any of the six senses, one’s mind is completely free from wanting. For one of peaceful mind, one completely liberated, there’s nothing further to be
done, no \[need to] increase what has been done.

As a stone mountain, one solid mass, is not stirred by the wind; so no sights, sounds, odours, tastes, touches or mind-objects, desirable or undesirable, stir the stability of the mind. This mind is steady and freed, and you witness the
vanishing of the mind.

<span className="sutta-ref">Sn 1048</span> And one who has considered all the contrasts on this earth,<br />
And is no more disturbed by anything whatever in the world,<br />
The peaceful one, freed from rage,<br />
From frustration, and from wanting,<br />
This stream of consciousnesses will not be reborn.<br />

<span className="sutta-ref">SN 5.10</span> \[Māra asks:] “By whom has this being been created? Where is the maker of this being? Where has this being arisen? Where does this being cease?”

\[The bhikkhunī arahant, Vajirā, replies:] “Why now do you assume ‘a being?’ Māra, is that your wrong view? This is a heap of _saṅkhārā_. Here no being is found.”

“Just as with a coming together of parts, the word ‘vehicle’ is used, so, when the five components of existence exist, there is the conventional term ‘a being.’”

“It is only dukkha (suffering) that comes to be, dukkha that stands, and dukkha that falls away. Nothing but dukkha comes to be. Nothing but dukkha ceases.”

<span className="sutta-ref">SN 48.53</span> An arahant understands that the six senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and the mind) will cease completely and totally without remainder and no other senses will arise anywhere in any way. This is another way one knows that there is nothing more to be done (one is an arahant).
