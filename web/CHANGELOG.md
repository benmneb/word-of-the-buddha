# Changelog

The `/content` here is the same as the `/epub` content, except:

1. The pandoc specific fenced attributes for [epub:type](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#the-epubtype-attribute) that docusaurus does not support or need have been removed.
1. Heading heirarchy for "The Noble Truth of the Way Leading to the Cessation of Suffering" sub-chapters have been adjusted (up one) to be semantically correct for the "one chapter per page" format of the web version. (commit 01b65be1a8b45f2551059eb755d228ee9e2b124e)
