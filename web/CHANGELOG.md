# Changelog

The `/content` here is the same as the `/epub` content, except:

1. The pandoc specific fenced attributes for [epub:type](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#the-epubtype-attribute) that docusaurus does not support or need have been removed.
1. Some heading levels have been adjusted (up one) to be semantically correct for the "one chapter per page" format of the web version.
